# Introduction to the Internet

## What is the Internet ?

The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It began as an academic research project in 1969, and became a global commercial network in the 1990s. The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the internet or controls who can connect to it. Instead, thousands of different organizations operate their own networks and negotiate voluntary interconnection agreements.

Most people access internet content using a web browser. Indeed, the web has become so popular that many people incorrectly treat the internet and the web as synonymous. But in reality, the web is just one of many internet applications. Other popular Internet applications include email and BitTorrent.

## Where is the Internet ?

3 Basic parts of the Internet:

- **The last mile** is the part of the internet that connects homes and small businesses to the internet. Connections provided by cable TV companies, fiber optic cables, towers that allow peoople access the internet with their cell phones.

- **Data centers** are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and content. Data centers can be located anywhere in the world, but they are often located in remote areas where land and electricity are cheap. For example, [Google](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/12/02/in-iowa-a-field-becomes-a-huge-google-server-farm/), [Facebook](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/11/facebook-iowa-wind/), and [Microsoft](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/06/microsoft-iowa-data-center/) have all constructed vast data centers in Iowa.

- **The backbone** consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — that carry data between data centers and consumers. Backbone providers frequently connect their networks together at [internet exchange points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_exchange_points_by_size), usually located in major cities. Establishing a presence at IEPs makes it much easier for backbone providers to improve their connections to others.

## Who created the Internet ?

he internet began as [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), an academic research network that was funded by the military’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). The project was led by [Bob Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(computer_scientist)), an ARPA administrator, and the network was built by the consulting firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman. It began operations in 1969.

In 1973, software engineers [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) and [Bob Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn) began work on the next generation of networking standards for the ARPANET. These standards, known as [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), became the foundation of the modern internet. ARPANET switched to using TCP/IP on January 1, 1983.

During the 1980s, funding for the internet shifted from the military to the [National Science Foundation.](http://www.nsf.gov/) The NSF funded the long-distance networks that served as the internet’s backbone from 1981 until 1994. In 1994, the Clinton Administration [turned control](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/24/business/us-begins-privatizing-internet-s-operations.html) over the internet backbone to the private sector. It has been privately operated and funded ever since.

## Who runs the internet ?

No one runs the internet. It’s organized as a decentralized network of networks. Thousands of companies, universities, governments, and other entities operate their own networks and exchange traffic with each other based on voluntary interconnection agreements.

The shared technical standards that make the internet work are managed by an organization called the [Internet Engineering Task Force.](http://www.ietf.org/) The IETF is an open organization; anyone is free to attend meetings, propose new standards, and recommend changes to existing standards. No one is required to adopt standards endorsed by the IETF, but the IETF’s consensus-based decision-making process helps to ensure that its recommendations are generally adopted by the internet community.

The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (ICANN) is sometimes described as being responsible for internet governance. As its name implies, ICANN is in charge of distributing domain names (like vox.com) and [IP addresses](http://www.vox.com/cards/the-internet/whats-an-ip-address). But ICANN doesn’t control who can connect to the internet or what kind of information can be sent over it.

# How the Internet Works

## Overview

At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.

The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet, it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next router in the path towards its destination. This process continues until the packet reaches its final destination.

To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). IP is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination, while TCP ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.

In addition to these core protocols, there are a wide range of other technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and data exchange over the internet, including the Domain Name System (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol. As a developer, it is important to have a solid understanding of how these different technologies and protocols work together to enable communication and data exchange over the internet.

## Basic Concepts and Terminology

- **Packet:** A small unit of data that is transmitted over the internet.

- **Router:** A device that directs packets of data between different networks.

- **IP Address:** A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network, used to route data to the correct destination.

- **Domain Name:** A human-readable name that is used to identify a website, such as google.com.

- **DNS:** The Domain Name System is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses.

- **HTTP:** The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website)

- **HTTPS**  An encrypted version of HTTP that is used to provide secure communication between a client and server.

- **SSL/TLS:** The Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security protocols are used to provide secure communication over the internet.

## The role of Protocols in Internet

Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data exchange over the internet. A protocol is a set of rules and standards that define how information is exchanged between devices and systems.

There are many different protocols used in internet communication, including the Internet Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the Domain Name System (DNS), and many others.

IP is responsible for routing packets of data to their correct destination, while TCP and UDP ensure that packets are transmitted reliably and efficiently. DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addresses, and HTTP is used to transfer data between clients and servers.

One of the key benefits of using standardized protocols is that they allow devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors to communicate with each other seamlessly. For example, a web browser developed by one company can communicate with a web server developed by another company, as long as they both adhere to the HTTP protocol.



## Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are two of the most commonly used protocols in internet-based applications and services.

HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a website, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the webpage or other resource you've requested. The server then sends an HTTP response back to the client, containing the requested data.

HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the data being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This provides an additional layer of security, helping to protect sensitive information such as login credentials, payment information, and other personal data.



## Building Applications with TCP/IP

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the underlying communication protocol used by most internet-based applications and services. It provides a reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices. Few key concept are: 

- **Ports:**  Ports are used to identify the application or service running on a device. Each application or service is assigned a unique port number, allowing data to be sent to the correct destination.

- **Sockets:** A socket is a combination of an IP address and a port number, representing a specific endpoint for communication. Sockets are used to establish connections between devices and transfer data between applications.

- **Connections:**  A connection is established between two sockets when two devices want to communicate with each other. During the connection establishment process, the devices negotiate various parameters such as the maximum segment size and window size, which determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.

- **Data transfer:** Once a connection is established, data can be transferred between the applications running on each device. Data is typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable delivery.

## Securing Internet Communication with SSL/TLS

A few key concepts to understand:

- **Certificates:** SSL/TLS certificates are used to establish trust between the client and server. They contain information about the identity of the server and are signed by a trusted third party (a Certificate Authority) to verify their authenticity.

- **Handshake:**  During the SSL/TLS handshake process, the client and server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and other parameters for the secure connection.

- **Encryption:** Once the secure connection is established, data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely between the client and server.

When building internet-based applications and services, it's important to understand how SSL/TLS works and to ensure that your application is designed to use SSL/TLS when transmitting sensitive data such as login credentials, payment information, and other personal data. You'll also need to ensure that you obtain and maintain valid SSL/TLS certificates for your servers, and that you follow best practices for configuring and securing your SSL/TLS connections.
